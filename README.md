# 🗞️ Northcoders News App 📰

Tech stack: : JavaScript, React.js, Vanilla CSS, Node.js, Axios.

Welcome to my Northcoders News app project! The aim of this project was to build a news app using my [NC News Api](https://github.com/jessieharper/northcoders-news-api) backend project. You can access the deployed app [here](https://nc-news-hessie.netlify.app/). You can use this app to:

- View and like/dislike articles
- View, post, and delete comments on articles
- Filter articles by topic
- Sort articles by title, author, and date created, in descending or ascending order (sorts by DESC by default)

In order to run this project locally, you will need to:

- Have a minimum version of v20.6.1 or higher of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current) installed.
- Run npm install to install required dependencies.
